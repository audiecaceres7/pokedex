# pokedex 
This is a CLI based on pokemon's famous tool for inspecting pokemons!

## Motivation
I grew up watching and played many video games of pokemon so i wanted to create this pokedex
CLI for all the programmers/non programmers that are pokemon lovers out there to have a great 
experience using the poke-api in your terminal 

## Installation
Running this command you can install the git repo
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/audiecaceres7/pokedex/
```
## Usage 
When the repo is done installing enter the pokedex folder
```bash
cd pokedex
```
You can run this command to open pokedex
```bash
./pokedex
```
You will be greeted and a usage message will be displayed
```bash
welcome to pokedex! ;)
